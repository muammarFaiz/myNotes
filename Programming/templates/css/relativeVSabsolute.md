relative:
- it does not change the position of the rest of your elements even if you move the relative element somewhere else with the top, bottom, left and right property.

absolute:
- it might change the position of the other elements, because once an element have an absolute property, the other elements will see as if the absolute element does not exist, so the common reaction will be the bottom elements will move upwards filling up the "empty" spot and the absolute element will move on top of its original static position.
- can also be moved around with top, bottom, left and right property.
