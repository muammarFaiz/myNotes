- i don't know why the first/initial push to heroku inside the folder that contain the JSX and CSS, when it contain a regular JS then it will give error and heroku won't accept the app.
- also my react app which contain more extra modules from npm and other stuff that you won't get initially with npx create-react-app, it will crash when you try to access it from heroku which is not happening with my local copy (yes i know you need to listen to process.env.PORT but there is no normal way we can do that because we use react-script, also if you upload the unedited create-react-app it will go smoothly no problem even without procfile so i guess the error is not from react-script), and its magically fixed using heroku buildpack for create-react-app.
