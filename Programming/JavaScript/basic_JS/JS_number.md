1. / and * will be computed first before + and -
2. it is good practice to use () even if it is only to show which number calculated first.
3. `var mynumber = 3;`

    `var my2number = mynumber++;`

    the value of my2number is 3, but the mynumber is 4.

    `mynumber = 3;`

    `var my3number = mynumber+=3;`

    the value of my3number is 6, and the value of mynumber is 6.
4. modular `%`
    - return the remainder of a number from the modular number.

      `var mynumber = 8%3`
      the value of mynumber is 2.
